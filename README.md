# shop
Online shop is a project I have been working on recently, it's fully operational, but I would like to improve it even further, upgrade some elements like styles in Css and few Php scripts, maybe add some new functions.

I used the PDO library in PHP, and lightbox plugin made by(Lightbox v2.10.0 Lokesh Dhakar) to show the thumbs.
I'll write more when I add something.

I added hashed passwords and verify function for sign up and log in.
I modified function that show menu and I added a navbar, now "cart" and "log in" are in navbar and menu have only categories. For smaller screens all things are in menu that is hidden, and opens with hamburger icon.
I also added some styles for new things and modified some code in Css. I'll try to improve it in the future.
